# SevenDay App

# Overview

SevenDay allows users to see their weekly forecast based on their zipcode.

Create a weather app using programmatic Autolayout. Your app should let the user input a zipcode, then see the 7-day forecast.  Selecting a forecast should display more information about the weather for that day, along with a random image of the city matching the zip code.  The user can favorite the image, then view a list of all of their favorited images.

# App Flow
Enter zipcode to retreive weekly forecast | Select a forecast to view additional information including a random image of the city matching the zip code and add to favorites | User can delete photos from their listof favorites

# Future Updates
In continuing to iterate on this project I would like to do the following:

- In the Favorites tab, incorporate a long press gesture on the image to present the city's name
- Add options for the user to see a 3-day forecast and an hourly forecast for the current day


### Technologies used

- Progrommatic AutoLayout
- File Manager to store favorites
- UIView Animation
