## App Flow
Enter zipcode to retrieve weekly forecast | Select a day to view additional weather information including a random image of the city matching the zip code and add to their favorites | User can delete photos from their list of favorites

## Endpoints

## Technologies used

- Progrommatic AutoLayout
- File Manager to store favorites
- UIView Animation



## Future Updates
In continuing to iterate on this project I would like to do the following:

- In the Favorites tab, incorporate a long press gesture on the image to present the city's name
- Add options for the user to see a 3-day forecast and an hourly forecast for the current day
